## Usage & Walkthrough

- The app starts with a stylish navigation bar (`Navbar`) and a hero section (`Header`).
- Scroll to explore sections: About Us, Menu, Chef's Word, Video Intro, Awards, Gallery, Find Us, and Footer.
- Each section is a React component/container, styled with modular CSS.
- The menu and awards are dynamically rendered from data in data.js.
- The gallery uses scrollable images and Instagram icons for a modern feel.
- The newsletter form allows users to subscribe for updates.
- The footer provides contact info, working hours, and social media links.

## Reusing Components

All components are designed to be reusable. Example usage:

```jsx
import { MenuItem, SubHeading, Navbar } from './components';

<MenuItem title="Chapel Hill Shiraz" price="$56" tags="AU | Bottle" />
<SubHeading title="Today's Special" />
<Navbar />
```

To use in other projects, copy the component folder and update imports as needed. Each component is self-contained with its CSS.
